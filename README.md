# CSVManager
Simple Java class for managing data with CSV files

Allows simple IO operations with CSV files.
List of all methods is described in the documentation file.

Allows data manipulation through adding or removing data lines using operating methods.
Several parameters to change: which column separator is used, do you have a header line, do you want to get error messagesâ€¦
You may change parameters for each instance or for all later created instances at once using static defaults.
